Open technical specifications and standards for the CivicOS ecosystem.

CivicOS Institute Standards Repository

Official Technical Specifications for the CivicOS Ecosystem & Logos Architecture
Maintained by CivicOS Institute



Overview

This repository hosts the open technical standards, specifications, and reference formats that define the CivicOS ecosystem. These documents establish a shared, interoperable foundation for transforming how municipalities, institutions, and communities structure, interpret, and operate public-service workflows.

All materials published here are open standards, not software. They are designed to support:
	•	Open collaboration
	•	Interoperable civic technology
	•	Transparent workflows
	•	Public-benefit research
	•	Vendor-neutral adoption
	•	Community governance
	•	Defense against proprietary lock-in

The Logos Engine—a separate, proprietary implementation—executes these standards, but the specifications themselves remain open for public use.

What This Repository Does Not Contain

This repository does not contain any proprietary code or implementation details for the Logos Engine or any CivicOS commercial product.

Specifically excluded:
	•	DRK (Deterministic Reasoning Kernel) implementation
	•	Legislative Compiler source code
	•	Routing and semantic models
	•	Proprietary rule graphs for real-world jurisdictions
	•	Workflow orchestration engines
	•	Deployment templates
	•	Internal prompts or LLM finetuning data

These remain closed-source and are maintained privately by CivicOS Institute and its authorized commercial partners.



Purpose & Philosophy

CivicOS Institute maintains these standards to ensure:

Transparency

The rules governing public interactions should be open, inspectable, and reviewable.

Equity

Digital access to law, permits, benefits, and essential services must be fair and inclusive.

Neutrality

Public infrastructure should not rely on proprietary black-box technologies.

Safety

Civic systems benefit from deterministic reasoning and provable correctness.

Public Stewardship

Regulatory logic should be a public good, not a private monopoly.

This repository embodies that mission.



How These Standards Are Used

Organizations may:
	•	Build tools that consume or produce CivicOS-compliant rule graphs
	•	Integrate CivicOS workflows into municipal systems
	•	Conduct academic or policy research
	•	Propose extensions or improvements
	•	Implement partial or full compatibility layers

The Logos Engine implements these standards fully and consistently, but third parties may build their own compatible engines if they wish.
